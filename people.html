					<h2>Barbara (babs) Buttenfield</h2>
					<h2>Co-PI and Leader for the Colorado Team</h2>
					<p>Dr. Buttenfield is a Professor Emerita in Geography at CU-Boulder, and a Research Faculty Affiliate at CU's Earth Lab. Her research interests focus on cartographic generalization, impacts of scale and resolution on geospatial data and models, graphic and database representations of uncertainty, and  visualization tools for geographic modeling. She retired	from teaching in December 2020 but remains research active and continues to mentor graduate advisees.  Current projects in addition to CroScaler include work with USGS to develop multi-scale versions of the National Hydrography Dataset, and an NSF-funded project (TRELIS) to mentor and retain women entering professional careers in geospatial science in academia, public and private sector positions.	</p>
